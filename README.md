A basic statistical analysis of Crime in Chicago from 2010 to 2017.

The data can be obtained from https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2 .

This project gives a basic statistical analysis using the crime rate in chicago from 2010 to 2017 using Python v 2.7 with matplot lib and pandas packages.

An analysis of the crimes commited by district on an average was also analysed as you can see from the Heatmap above and the box plot denoting crimes commited(in blue) and arrests made (in red) for each district. As shown in the graph,district 31 is shown to be the safest.However,for this project,I did not take population of each district into concideration as there was no data available.Having said that,these graphs gives a pretty good estimate of crimes commited in chicago
